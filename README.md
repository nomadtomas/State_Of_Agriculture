# State_Of_Agriculture
Agriculture has such broad economic, technological, and political implications.  President Lincoln not only established the Department of Agriculture in 1862, he referred to it as the “people’s department”.  It is precisely the people that represent this sector that this study will focus.  The scope of the analysis is focusing on five row-crops (corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, and hay) given that they account for roughly 90 percent of harvest acreage in the US.  Along with this analysis I will be utilizing a linear regression and random forest models to try to predict end-of-year production for the row crop commodities.

## Approach:
The approach will be to gather datasets regarding row crop production and integrating farm size and type.  The model will incorporate location at the district level for each state with production.  Through the linear model I will try to find which commodities are more correlated given the mutual exclusivity of farming (if you plan corn this year you did not plant cotton).  K-mean clustering will be implemented to try to find commonalities between similar type farms and their crop fluctuation from year to year.

## Data Sources:
The main data source I will be using will be from the National Agricultural Statistics Service.  https://www.nass.usda.gov/.   They have all data required for the project, though it will require multiple methods of incorporating such information.
